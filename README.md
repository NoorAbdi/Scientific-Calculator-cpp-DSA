# Scientific Calculator in C++

This repository contains a C++ program for a basic scientific calculator. This calculator can perform various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent.
- Logarithmic functions: natural logarithm (ln) and base 10 logarithm (log10).
- Exponential functions: e^x and 10^x.
- Square root and power functions.
- Memory operations: store and recall values.
- Clear screen and reset memory options.
