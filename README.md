# Scientific Calculator in C++

This repository contains a C++ program for a basic scientific calculator. This calculator can perform various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.

## Features

- the calculator should have + - / x   
- Basic trigonometry function: sin cos tan 
- More than basic function: square root, exp, log, ln 
- The calculator can input up to 10 or more variables and parameters. It is not limited to 2 + 2, 3 x 3, etc. 
- Inside the code, you apply the class function (separate class, inline class, constructor, etc.) 
- Inside the code, you apply the linked list or queue function
- It can delete and show the history of the calculator 

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you'll need:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scientific-Calculator-cpp-DSA.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd calculator.cpp
   ```

3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
   ```

4. Run the calculator:

   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

## Usage

- The calculator has a simple command-line interface.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
- Use the specified keywords or symbols to select operations.
